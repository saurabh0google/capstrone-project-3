NYC fire cases

INTRODUCTION

As there is a rise in fire cases in the New York City and as a Data Scientist I aim to find out a relation between the fire cases and increaing food joints inn the city. A lot of fire originates from the city and hence it is important to analyse the problem.
This will not only help people to find safer homes but also keep the fire department alerted for any future mishappening.
We'll use a number of data bases and FOURSQUARE api to determine the food joints and fire risk in an area depending on in ZIP CODE.



DATA USED

A number of datasets will be used in the Project:

1. Fire DEpartment Dataset (To analyse past fire incidents)
2. Loaction Database (to extract Coordinates)
3. FOURSQUARE api (to determine food joints in the proximity of fire effected place)

The fire department dataset have ZIP Code of the affected area.
This Zip code is matched with the coordinated for plotting
Also it is used to find the Food joints and cluster them on the bases of how prone they are to fire depending on previous data stored by fire department
